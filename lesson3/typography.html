            <h2>
                Typography
            </h2>
            <p>
                The best way to chose typography is that the font of the headings and the paragraphs should different.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Heading Font: Roboto Slab

            </h2>
            <p>
                This font creates a uniform view on the page and it is simple but at the
                same time modern.

            </p>

            <h2>
                Paragraph Font: Montserrat

            </h2>
            <p>
                This font match to the other is not confusing, it's easy to recognize
                that both are different and that helps to create harmony on the view.
                Adding to this the font creates a feeling of trust.

            <h2>
                Normal paragraph example
            </h2>
            <p>
                Everyone should learn to mountain bike on a hardtail, no exceptions. I learned to ride on a hardtail, as
                did many people, particularly the ones that have been around bikes for a long time, and I’d wager that
                most of those people would agree with me. I see many beginner riders these days riding full suspension
                bikes, and yes they make riding easier, but they’re cheating themselves out of learning fundamental
                skills and instead may learn bad habits.
